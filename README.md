# Machine-Learning-with-SVM-Model
The attach file is the assignment I did when I was studying bachelor of science in managenment mathematics with computing at Tun Abdul Rahman University College. This assignment is to train the data from kaggle(NBA Team Game Stats from 2014 to 2018 - https://www.kaggle.com/ionaskel/nba-games-stats-from-2014-to-2018) by using machine learning approach and the model I use is Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

### Objective & Outcome
The objective of train the data is to predict the winrate of the team and the team we choose to predict is alt. The accuracy of the prediction is 0.76.
